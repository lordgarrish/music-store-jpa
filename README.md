# music-store-jpa
Music store website made with JavaEE, Servlets, JSP and JPA (Hibernate).

This is a different version of music-store application, now with the support of Java Persistence API.

The JPA version includes the JPA libraries. More specifically, the JPA
version uses Hibernate 5. Then, it uses the persistence.xml file to
configure a connection to a database named music_store_jpa.

The user interface is the same for both versions of this website. In other
words, both websites use the same HTML and CSS.<br>
The business classes for the JPA version have been slightly modified and now include the JPA (and occasionally Hibernate) 
annotations that map the business objects to the database tables.
All CRUD operations are now made by classes in 'lordgarrish.dao' package, thus implementing the DAO pattern.<br>
I've refactored much of the controller classes code to make it more readable and to support new persistence level design.
The directory structure, the web.xml file are also the same.<br>
Database schema is now automatically generated by Hibernate and all tables are created when you first time access the catalog page.
